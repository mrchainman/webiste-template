# Website Template
This repo containes some template files for a basic webpage.
### Usage
Every php file should include the setup.php file, in order to prevent having to rewrite the same thing over and over again.
The CSS file uses variables defined at the top of the file. Settings for the desktop version can be set at the bottom,
the rest applies to the mobile version.
